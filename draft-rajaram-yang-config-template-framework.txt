         Populating a list of YANG data nodes using templates.
                  draft-yang-config-template-framework

Abstract

   This document presents a modeling technique for configuring large
   size devices in a compact way, when the device contains many similar
   data node patterns.  This is realized by instructing the device to
   locally generate repetitive patterns of data nodes from a master copy
   called 'template' that is configured in the device.  This technique
   is convenient and efficient as it reduces the running data store size
   and the network provisioning time.  This modelling technique uses the
   current YANG specification features to date, with off-the shelf
   toolset.

1.  Introduction

   This draft considers the case of a device that contains a functional
   entity, characterized by a well-defined data nodes pattern, that is
   massively replicated and where each replication instance needs
   individual configuration with only limited variation.

   Having a device manager that repetitively configures the device with
   each data nodes of each functional instance can become inconvenient
   and error prone.  It could lead to performance issues, like long
   device configuration time, large memory footprint in the device and
   inefficient YANG validation procedures due to the large running data
   store size.  This becomes more and more difficult as the system grows
   larger.

   This draft proposes a technique to improve this, that is based on
   'YANG templates' and that results in a small size running data store
   even when the device is very large.

   We will call a 'YANG template' the configuration of a functional
   entity that the device is instructed to replicate multiple times to
   generate copies of the entity.  The technique that we address in this
   draft allows to generate copies with the same data node values as in
   the template with the possibility, though, to overrule some of these
   values on an individual copy basis.

   The general template technique detailed in this draft RFC does not
   suffer from the drawbacks mentioned earlier when the device manager
   explicitly configuring all device data nodes.  Moreover, it relies on
   features available in the YANG language defined to date and it is
   supported by existing off-the-shelf toolset.

   This method is not aimed at becoming a standard itself.  It is a YANG
   modeling technique that can be considered, where appropriate, by any
   vendor or standardization organization, when designing a YANG module
   for a specific purpose.

   In the next sections we'll elaborate on some of the constructs to
   apply the template technique and highlight how to mitigate some
   potential issues.  More specifically, - How to define the template of
   a functional entity and how to instruct the device to replicate it,
   including per instance variations.  - How the replication process
   takes place when expanding the template into functional entity
   instances configuration data nodes.

2.  Template technique framework

2.1.  Provisioning the running data store

   This section outlines how the device's running data store is utilized
   to implement the template technique.

   In the YANG model of the device, many functional instances can be
   organized in a list.  Since a template represents the typical
   configuration pattern of a functional instance, it is often necessary
   to choose between multiple templates for replication.  For Example:
   The device may host various types of functional instances, each with
   its own specific data structure.  Say, one template might define data
   nodes for a 'function-1' type, while another template could define
   nodes for a 'function-2' type.  For a given type of functional
   instance, different sets of values for the data nodes may be
   required.  Say, a 'function-1' type might have templates for
   'function-1-bronze-grade', 'function-1-silver-grade', and 'function-
   1-gold-grade' variants.  As a result, multiple templates can also be
   organized into a list within the device's YANG model.

   Assume for example, that “list a” and “list b” data nodes need to be
   configured in the device.  Traditionally, the tree structure will be
   as below:

   root

    +--(...)                     // out of scope
    |
    +--rw data-nodes-pattern     // container for functional instances

     +--rw instance* [name]    // the list of functional instances
        +--rw name             string-ascii64
        +--rw description?     string-ascii128
        +--rw data
           +--rw list-a [name] //e.g. a list of interfaces
           |  +--rw name
           |  +--rw parm-x
           |  +--rw parm-y
           |
           +--rw list-b [name] //e.g. a list of hardware components
              +--rw name
              +--rw parm-t
              +--rw parm-u

   In contrast, the YANG tree of a device using the template technique
   would appear as below:

   root

    +--(...)                     // out of scope
    +--rw data-nodes-pattern     // container for functional instances
    +--rw template* [name]    // the list of templates
    |  +--rw name             string-ascii64
    |  +--rw description?     string-ascii128
    |  +--rw data
    |     +--rw list-a [name] //e.g. a list of interfaces
    |     |  +--rw name
    |     |  +--rw parm-x
    |     |  +--rw parm-y
    |     |
    |     +--rw list-b [name] //e.g. a list of hardware components
    |        +--rw name
    |        +--rw parm-t
    |        +--rw parm-u
    |
    +--rw instance* [name]    // the list of functional instances
       +--rw name             string-ascii64
       +--rw description?     string-ascii128
       +--rw template?        -> /data-nodes-pattern/template/name
       +--rw data
          +--rw list-a [name] //e.g. a list of interfaces
          |  +--rw name
          |  +--rw parm-x
          |  +--rw parm-y
          |
          +--rw list-b [name] //e.g. a list of hardware components
             +--rw name
             +--rw parm-t
             +--rw parm-u

   Each entry in the 'template' list encompasses the generic
   configuration data nodes that are needed for all the functional
   entities to be addressed by this template, as contained in the 'data'
   container, in this example, ‘data nodes of list-a’ and ‘list-b’.

   In practice, naturally, the more data nodes that can be replicated
   the more efficient the template technique will be.

   Each entry in the 'instance’ list represents a copy to be made of the
   data nodes pattern defined by the leaf-ref 'template', to create a
   functional entity instance.  The 'data' container contains all the
   data nodes needed to customize each copy of the template, by
   overruling one or the other data node value originating from the
   template, or possibly to add to the copy one or the other data nodes
   not provided by the template.

   Although it is recommended that the same data nodes are defined in
   the 'data' container of 'template' and the 'data' container of
   'instance’, only a limited number of such data nodes should be
   configured in the 'instance’. This reflects the assumption that
   functional instances should have only limited variations from their
   template model.

   It should be noted that in a good application of the template
   technique, only few templates would suffice to generate a very large
   number of functional instances; in other words, the 'instance’ list
   would be much larger, typically by order of magnitudes, than the
   'template' list.

   A simple configuration example in the running data store of the
   device can be found at Appendix A.1

2.2.  Device expanding the running data store

   Once the configuration is applied to the device, the device will
   dynamically create each instance as specified.  The process for
   generating data nodes for a particular instance follows these steps:
   •A copy of the template's data nodes is made, serving as the
   foundation for the instance's configuration. •If any of these data
   nodes are also configured in the running data store for this
   instance, they will override the template values.  If an instance
   data node is configured in the running data store but not provided by
   the template, it will be added to the generated instance
   configuration.

   The resulting instance expansion corresponding to the example in
   appendix A.1 is provided in Appendix A.2

2.3.  Mandatories and Defaults

   While conceptually, the idea of templates improves the re-usability
   and consistency factor, there are certain nuances, which need to be
   addressed while handling data nodes in the grouping with defaults and
   mandatories.

   If certain replicable data patterns contain default or mandatory
   values, and are used as-is both in the template and in the instance,
   -there is a possibility of silent and unintentional overwriting the
   configured value of the node in the template with the default value
   in the instance due to the merge operation. -Mandatory data nodes
   must be unconditionally configured in the instance although they are
   already configured in the template, reducing the efficiency of the
   template mechanism.

Internet-Draft           yang-template-framework            October 2024


   Hence, while the same data nodes are used in the templates and
   instances, it is imperative that instance data nodes are without
   default and mandatory statements.

   An easy way to do so is to define data nodes in a grouping without
   any mandatory or default statement.  The grouping is suitable for use
   as-is in the instance definition, while, when used for the template
   definition, it just needs to be refined by adding mandatory and
   default statements where appropriate.  Appendix B. provides some more
   details and an example.

3.  Benefits of Templates in YANG Design

   1.  Reusability: Templates encourage reusability by allowing common
       structures to be defined once and reused multiple times.  This
       reduces duplication and simplifies model management.

   2.  Consistency: By using templates, similar configurations are
       defined and applied uniformly, leading to more consistent data
       modeling and network configuration management.

   3.  Simplified Maintenance: When a template is modified, all places
       where it is used will automatically reflect those changes,
       reducing the effort required to maintain and update the model.

   4.  Modularity: Templates promote a modular approach to YANG model
       design.  By splitting the model into reusable parts, it becomes
       easier to scale and extend.

   come from the running data store, instead of being locally expanded):

4.2.  Appendix B.  Using existing yang constructs in template and
      instance YANG definition

   This appendix illustrates the use of groupings in the YANG definition
   of template and instances and more specifically it shows how easily
   mandatory and default statements can be introduced in the template
   definition by ‘refining’ the grouping ‘use’ statement.

4.2.1.  The ‘grouping’ construct

   By defining common structures using grouping, one avoids repeating
   code, ensures consistency and makes future changes easier since
   modifications only need to happen in one place.

   Example:

Internet-Draft           yang-template-framework            October 2024


    grouping interface-config {
    leaf parm-a {
      type string;
    }
    leaf parm-b {
      type boolean;
    }
    leaf parm-c {
      type unint32;
    }

   } This ‘interface-config’ grouping defines a common structure that
   can be reused across different YANG modules or different parts of the
   same module.

4.2.2.  The ‘uses’ statement

   The ‘uses’ statement applies a previously defined grouping where
   needed in the model (e.g. it copies the data nodes of the grouping at
   the place of the ‘use’ statement’.

   As an example, the data nodes defined in the grouping above can be
   used in the template and in the instance definition:

Internet-Draft           yang-template-framework            October 2024


    container data-nodes-pattern {
    list template {
     key “name”;
     leaf name {
       type string;
     }
     container data {
       list interface {
         key "interface-name";
         leaf name {
           type string;
         }
         uses interface-config;
       }
      }
     }
   list instance {
     key “name”;
     leaf name {
       type string;
     }
     container data {
       list interface {
         key "interface-name";
         leaf name {
           type string;
         }
         uses interface-config;
       }
      }
     }
    }

4.2.3.  The ‘refine’ statement to control default and mandatory
        statements

   As explained in section 2.4, with the template method, some data
   nodes may need a default or mandatory statement when used for the
   template definition but should have no mandatory neither default
   statements when used for the instance definition.

   The ‘refine’ statement available in existing YANG version easily
   allows to control mandatory and default statements when used along
   with the ‘uses’ statement.

   Assume in our example that it is desired that ‘parm-b’ has a default
   statement and ‘parm-c’ has a mandatory statement when they are used
   for the template definition.

Internet-Draft           yang-template-framework            October 2024


   Then the YANG becomes:

    container data-nodes-pattern {
    list template {
     key “name”;
     leaf name {
       type string;
     }
     container data {
       list interface {
         key "interface-name";
         uses interface-config {
           refine parm-b {
             default “true”
           }
           refine parm-c {
             mandatory true
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   list instance {
     key “name”;
     leaf name {
       type string;
     }
     container data {
       list interface {
         key "interface-name";
         uses interface-config;
       }
     }
   }   }

5.  Conclusion

   Using templates in YANG allows to efficiently configure large amounts
   of similar data nodes while keeping the running data store size
   small.  This is beneficial in term of device memory footprint, ease
   of configuration, configuration time and potentially YANG validation
   processing in the device.  This draft explains some practicalities of
   the template method, including how to ensure that mandatory and
   default statements don’t jeopardize the effectiveness of the method.

6.  Further Work

   A follow up draft is planned which will address how the template
   method described in this draft could also be used considering data
   nodes already defined in existing standards.
