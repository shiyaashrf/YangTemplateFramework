   Principle for populating list of YANG data nodes using a template
                               technique.
                  draft-yang-config-template-framework

Abstract

   Some devices can host a specific functional entity (e.g. a sub-
   system) which is replicated a large number of times, where each such
   functional instance is to be controlled by a set of data nodes.  This
   can lead to long device configuration times, large memory footprint
   in the device and inefficient YANG validation procedures due to the
   large running data store size.

   This RFC considers the case of a device where each such functional
   instance is to be controlled by a set of data nodes with almost
   identical values from instance to instance.  In this case this RFC
   proposes a generic method that improves the inefficiency issues
   mentioned above.

   Rather than defining a YANG model where all data nodes of all
   instances need to be configured one by one in the device running data
   store by the management system (e.g. a NC client), this RFC presents
   the idea of a generic YANG model in which the running data store is
   configured with a list of instances without explicit data node being
   configured and the instruction to locally populate each instance's
   data nodes with a copy of a "model" data node set (called "template")
   that is configured in the running data store.

   Although the data nodes controlling instances have largely similar
   values across instances, a small number of data nodes may need
   however to have a value that differs from the ones in the common
   template, from instance to instance.  The generic method presented in
   this RFC also gives the possibility to overule or complement values
   originating from the template, on a per instance basis.

   This RFC presents a generic model - a generic method rather - that
   relies on features available in YANG 1.1, supported by off-the-shelf
   toolset.  It has no ambition to become a standard track itself,
   instead it should be considered as a method that can be used when
   designing a module for a specific purpose, possibly a specific
   standard.
